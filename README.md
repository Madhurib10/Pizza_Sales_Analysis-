To showcase my SQL skills, I created a project analyzing pizza sales data. I tackled various questions 
by writing and executing SQL queries, extracting insights on revenue distribution, category performance, and sales trends. 
This project demonstrated my ability to handle complex data analysis and optimize sales strategies.
